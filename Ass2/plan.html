	<h1>CP1406/CP1806/CP5638 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
	<h2>Name: Baked Family</h2>
	<h2>Goals</h2>
	<p>We are a small family-run local business, operating in Kirwan since 2012, hoping to improve our business by getting on
		the Internet. We specialise in traditional Australian baked goods. </p>
	<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
	<p> We also want to show some sample images of the products to be displayed to attract the site visitors’ attention. We
		want our customers to be able to sign up for weekly specials! We think there should be a page for our weekly specials to
		further attract customers. </p>
	<h2>Target Audience</h2>
	<p> We have customers of all ages, however, we would like to attract young families and young people, possibly around the
		age of 17 – 35, to our bakery.</p>
